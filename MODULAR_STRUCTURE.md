# Cognito Modular Structure

The codebase has been refactored to use a modular structure, breaking down the monolithic content script into smaller, more focused modules.

## Benefits of Modular Structure

- **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Better Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Team members can work on different modules without conflicts.
- **Code Reusability**: Functionality can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules.

## Module Overview

The modules are located in `/frontend/js/modules/` and include:

### Core Modules
- **utils.js**: General utility functions
- **text-processor.js**: Text extraction and analysis
- **message-handler.js**: Inter-component messaging

### UI Modules
- **sidebar-ui.js**: Sidebar creation and management
- **layout-manager.js**: UI layout adjustments

### Integration Modules
- **google-docs-api.js**: Google Docs API integration
- **outline-manager.js**: Outline functionality

### Helper Files
- **index.js**: Exports all modules for easier imports
- **README.md**: Documentation for the module structure

## Migration Notes

1. The content.js file now uses a modular approach, importing functionality from specialized modules
2. The manifest.json has been updated to use the modular content script

## Testing Considerations

When testing, ensure that:
1. The sidebar still loads and functions correctly
2. Google Docs integration still works as expected
3. Layout adjustments work properly when the sidebar is toggled
4. All messaging between components works as before

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for each module
- Further refactor large classes (especially in sidebar.js)
- Implement module bundling for better performance
