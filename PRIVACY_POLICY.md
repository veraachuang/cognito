# Cognito Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** April 29, 2023

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Cognito ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our Chrome extension for Google Docs ("Cognito" or the "Extension").

We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide to Us

- **Google Account Information**: When you authorize Cognito through Google OAuth, we receive limited access to your Google profile information, including your email address. This is used solely for authentication purposes.

- **Document Content**: When you use Cognito's AI writing assistance features, we process the text from your Google Doc that you're actively working on or have specifically selected for analysis.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Usage Data**: We collect information about how you interact with our Extension, including features you use, buttons you click, and actions you take within the Extension.

- **Technical Information**: We collect information about your browser and device when you use our Extension, including browser type and version, time zone setting, and operating system.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our Extension
- Develop new features and functionality
- Process and analyze document content to provide AI-powered writing assistance
- Authenticate your identity and authorize access to your Google Docs
- Debug issues and optimize performance
- Ensure security and prevent fraud or abuse

## Data Storage and Security

- **Document Content**: Document content is transmitted securely via HTTPS to our processing servers for the sole purpose of generating AI-powered writing assistance. This content is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored beyond the time needed to generate suggestions.

- **Authentication Tokens**: OAuth tokens are stored securely in your browser's encrypted storage and are only used to authenticate with Google services.

- **Security Measures**: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:

- **Third-Party Service Providers**: We may share information with service providers who help us operate our Extension (e.g., hosting, analytics, and AI processing services).

- **Compliance and Legal Obligations**: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.

- **Business Transfers**: If we're involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:

- **Access**: You can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
- **Correction**: You can request that we correct inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Deletion**: You can request that we delete your personal information.
- **Restriction**: You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal information.
- **Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

## Extension Permissions

Cognito requires certain permissions to function properly. Here's why we need each permission:

- **identity** and **identity.email**: Required for Google OAuth authentication to access your Google Docs.
- **activeTab**: Allows Cognito to interact with the current Google Doc you're editing.
- **scripting**: Enables Cognito to integrate its features into the Google Docs interface.
- **storage**: Stores your preferences and settings locally on your device.
- **host_permissions** (for specific domains): Enables communication with Google Docs, our AI services, and authentication servers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the Extension or by other means.

## International Data Transfers

We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own. Our servers are primarily located in the United States. If you are accessing our Extension from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers are located.
