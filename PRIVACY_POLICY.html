    <h1>Cognito Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 29, 2023</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Cognito ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our Chrome extension for Google Docs ("Cognito" or the "Extension").</p>
    
    <p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information</strong>: When you authorize Cognito through Google OAuth, we receive limited access to your Google profile information, including your email address. This is used solely for authentication purposes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Document Content</strong>: When you use Cognito's AI writing assistance features, we process the text from your Google Doc that you're actively working on or have specifically selected for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We collect information about how you interact with our Extension, including features you use, buttons you click, and actions you take within the Extension.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Technical Information</strong>: We collect information about your browser and device when you use our Extension, including browser type and version, time zone setting, and operating system.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our Extension</li>
        <li>Develop new features and functionality</li>
        <li>Process and analyze document content to provide AI-powered writing assistance</li>
        <li>Authenticate your identity and authorize access to your Google Docs</li>
        <li>Debug issues and optimize performance</li>
        <li>Ensure security and prevent fraud or abuse</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document Content</strong>: Document content is transmitted securely via HTTPS to our processing servers for the sole purpose of generating AI-powered writing assistance. This content is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored beyond the time needed to generate suggestions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens</strong>: OAuth tokens are stored securely in your browser's encrypted storage and are only used to authenticate with Google services.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Security Measures</strong>: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong>: We may share information with service providers who help us operate our Extension (e.g., hosting, analytics, and AI processing services).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Compliance and Legal Obligations</strong>: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: If we're involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>

        <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: Allows Cognito to interact with the current Google Doc you're editing.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting</strong>: Enables Cognito to integrate its features into the Google Docs interface.</li>
        <li><strong>storage</strong>: Stores your preferences and settings locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions</strong> (for specific domains): Enables communication with Google Docs, our AI services, and authentication servers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the Extension or by other means.</p>
